## Project 10 - Description

**(M)** is a SVR-type approach of your choice (in particular, with one or more kernels of your choice).

**(A1**) is an algorithm of the class of level bundle methods, applied to either the primal or the dual formulation of the SVR.

**(A2**) is a general-purpose solver applied to an appropriate formulation of the problem.

Use of an off-the-shelf solver for the Master Problem of the bundle method is allowed.
