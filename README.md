# SVR Optimization Project

## Description
This project implements a Support Vector Regression (SVR) method using different optimization techniques:
- **(M)** An SVR approach with one or more chosen kernels
- **(A1)** A level bundle method algorithm applied to either the primal or dual formulation of SVR
- **(A2)** A general-purpose solver applied to an appropriate formulation of the problem

The use of an off-the-shelf solver for the Master Problem of the bundle method is allowed

## Requirements
- **MATLAB**
- MATLAB Add-ons: Symbolic Toolbox, Optimization Toolbox, and Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
